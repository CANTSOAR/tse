The Scarlet Exchange

A simulated order book to be used for Rutgers Quantitative Finance Club (QFC) competitions. This is hugely inspired by IMC's Prosperity, but not intended to be a direct copy.

algo.py is meant for contestants to modify, while there will be hidden bot files that can be used to generate training and testing data.

Feel free to fork and improve
